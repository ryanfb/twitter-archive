  	      “It takes a great deal of patience to do good things in public. The world believes itself to be the expert in everything, while putting the bit under the horse's tail. Criticizing everything and accomplishing nothing, that is the world's nature.”<br><br><a href="http://www.bible-researcher.com/luther01.html">http://www.bible-researcher.com/luther01.html</a>
