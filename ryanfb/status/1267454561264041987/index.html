  	      My mother-in-law’s salon was damaged and burglarized last night in Raleigh. A Black-owned business for 20 years. But property isn’t life and nobody was hurt. You can help them rebuild here, every little bit helps &amp; is appreciated: <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebuild-salon?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=m_pd+share-sheet">https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebuild-salon?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=m_pd+share-sheet</a>
