  	      One thing I haven't really seen discussed in all the hand-wringing about cursive, is that being able to read historical documents depends very little on your familiarity with a given script or hand.<br><br>What really makes or breaks reading them is knowing the language and context. <a href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1579484660224389121">https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1579484660224389121</a>

  	      You could learn how to read the individual letters and ligatures of a cursive ancient Greek script with high accuracy, for example.<br><br>You'd still get blown out of the water trying to transcribe a document written in it by a papyrologist with knowledge of the language and context.

  	      In any case, I remain very skeptical of the idea that teaching kids cursive in elementary school produces adults who can easily read historical documents written in other cursive hands: <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanfb/status/1571523974366130177">https://twitter.com/ryanfb/status/1571523974366130177</a>

  	      Interestingly, the original motivation for teaching cursive was to make the student a more appealing hire for the business world—the same logic which is now eliminating cursive instruction, because your handwriting now makes very little difference to most businesses.

  	      If you’re genuinely concerned about people’s ability to read and understand historical documents, fighting for funding for the humanities seems like a much more straightforward and effective political project than fighting for elementary cursive
